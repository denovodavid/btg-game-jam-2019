# [BTG Semester Break Game Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/btgjam19)

> Theme: **Brave the Elements**

## Cloudburst

_I'm afraid of the ocean. Sail a boat through a storm._

## Developing

The game is developed with **[Unity]**.  
Clone it, and open the folder with Unity.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/smeagolem/btg-game-jam-2019.git
```

### Requirements

- [Git] or a Git GUI
- [Git LFS]
- [Git Flow]
- [Unity]

## Contributing

Using **[Unity Hub]** can help with managing multiple Unity installations. You may need to go to the download archive to find the correct version.

This project uses **[Git LFS]** (Large File Storage) for managing binary and asset files such as **images** and **3D models**. This is to support very large files without slowing down git or causing unnecessary pulling and diffing. Most of the common file types should be automatically detected by [Git LFS] (once installed) and git usage from there on should be as normal.

This project employs a branching model based on **[Git Flow]**. This is to make individuals contribute in a consistent manner and provide common shortcut commands using the CLI. There are some Git GUIs that support [Git Flow] such as [GitKraken] and [SmartGit].

Once cloning the repository, the [Git Flow] CLI can be initiliased with `git flow init`, and then get those `feature/*` branches started! 

Git commit messages should start with a current tense verb like **add** or **update**.  
For example:  
`add readme`  
`update that art asset`  
`fix that annoying bug`

Aaaandd... If you feel so inclined, why not try [Gitmoji] for a bit of :sparkles:
